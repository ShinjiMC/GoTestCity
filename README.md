Go Test City is an extension of GoCity, which implements the Code City metaphor for visualizing source code. GoCity represents a Go program as a city, using the following concepts:

- Folders are districts
- Files are buildings
- Structs are represented as buildings placed on top of their corresponding files

## Structure Characteristics

- The number of lines of code (LOC) determines the building color (higher values result in darker buildings)
- The number of variables (NOV) affects the buildingâ€™s base size
- The number of methods (NOM) influences the building height
